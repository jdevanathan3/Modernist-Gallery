      <h2>About The Birth of Venus</h2>
<p>This work was created by Sandro Boticelli in 1486. Although this painting isn't a modernist painting in its own right, it represents the definition of beautry, as it portrays the birth of the most beautiful goddess. Through a large canvas and strict preservation, Boticelli was able to keep his work existent until today, and thus writers and artists alike through the centuries have marveled at this piece of art.
<p> One writer in particular, Amy Lowell, was a Modernist writer who wrote about female beauty. Furthermore, she referenced this very picture as a challenge to stereotypical beauty, comparing her addressee in the poem <i>Venus Transiens</i> to the exact Venus in this picture, redefining the terms of beauty and awe to be held in the eyes of the beholder. This painting, although made hundereds of years before Lowell's time, was able to find a place in Modernist literature. </p>
