        <h2> Preface </h2>

<h3> Overview </h3>
<p> I’ve decided to focus on early Modernism for my digital chapter. This was a time of reworking of literature, at a point when writers traveled abroad and left their own countries to learn more about what literature should be, and what it should entail. Modernist writers at this point in time saw a dead end for society where others saw progress, and focused on writings that looked at inward loneliness, or inward problems caused by society. From Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot to Amy Lowell, writers worked to adapt a new type of writing style, from poetry to imagery. An interesting part of Modernism is that it not only affected writing at the time, but art as well. Some writers, such as Gertrude Stein, were influenced by art, and incorporated that into their writing. For example, Stein was heavily influenced by cubism in art, a theme of fusing multiple perspectives into one, and applied that to her writing about an American immigrant family. Art styles, such as cubism, imagery, and impressionism, can be connected to contemporary writings from various writers at the time. This is the key behind the technological idea that I have for a digital chapter: a linked gallery. </p>

<h3>Distinction as a Digital Chapter</h3>
<p>I’ve defined a linked gallery as a set of images that, when clicked, point to a collection of resources and material to which they are related. In this case, the images would be paintings displayed in a gallery-like format, and, when clicked, they would redirect to a page containing various authors that had some connection to their work. This would include a lot of repeats, as many authors can be drawn to various works. The idea is to have one main page on each author and their works, with ties to each image in a set of links. I’d like to relate each set of works visually to a painting or set of paintings, to give the user an idea of what Modernism was through both sight and reading. The difference between this digital chapter and previous content that we’ve studied is that this will be mostly visual. One of the major problems with collections and analyses that we’ve read on literary history is that they are mostly designed for reference; it’s hard for an outsider to literature generally interested in the past of American literary works to jump into a detailed book. However, with an introduction of a set of pictures, any ordinary person can click on pictures and be redirected to Modernist works, thanks to the gallery layout of the site. It’s similar to a visual recommendation of what the user should read; if a painting interests a user, he or she can click on the picture to learn more about it and related literary works. In the literary history books that we’ve read, analyses, order, and organization is also left up to the author or authors; organization of content and inclusion of content is decided on a linear basis, and content that may be particularly meaningful to the reader can’t be found easily. This digital chapter is focused around the user, allowing paintings from the period to serve as visual recommendations to what he or she should read or learn more about.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>This approach is, in a way, adaptive of the approach that a New Literary History of America, our current reading, has on introducing articles and literature; by related images. By using images that date from early Modernism, I hope to create an environment that will help users understand better the writings of the time, and how they connect to the paintings of the time. I want to re-define the term gallery to include more than just static paintings, or a chapter than just static text. I want to combine the two into something that will really help people understand more about the Modernist period of American literature, and the Modernist period as a whole. People, upon encountering this website, will be interested immediately in the paintings proposed, but will be more engaged in how they relate to writings, and most particularly what writings they might identify the most with. I’d like to think of the gallery/writing setup as a Netflix-like suggestion scenario, where the images the user clicks on directly match to what authors or works he or she should read. The purpose of this project is purely to draw in and interest people, not to force an extensive collection and analyses of Modernist writings onto the user. As far as a personal level, users may not be incredibly affected, but it might help people generate questions about connections between works of our own society. Do paintings and writings share similar characteristics? Can writing be judged on a similar criteria as visual work? Can linked visual works and writing proportionally increase and decrease in significance and popularity? These questions are definitely those which readers may want to ask themselves.</p>
