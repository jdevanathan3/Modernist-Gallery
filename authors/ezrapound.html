      <h2>Ezra Pound: In Writing</h2>
      <i>Left: Ezra Pound, photographed in 1913</i>
      <br>
<p>Ezra Pound started his poetic carrer in England, where he devised the poetic style, Imagism. In this, Pound embraced the idea that poetry should be a dry object of language, or merely the comparison of images. He illustrates this in his poem <i>In a Station of the Metro</i>:</p>
<blockquote>The apparition of these faces in the crowd; <br>
  Petals on a wet, black bough.
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>The use of a semicolon in separating the two lines represents the uncertainty of their relation: a colon would have implied a direct similarity, while a period would have deemed them separate. This added with the exclusion of words encourages the reader to make his own interpretation.</p>
<p>Pound went on to write the Cantos, a work of poetry meant to be similar to those of the Iliad and the Odyssey, but much more fragmented to embody the broennes of the world that he now lives in. Traveling around the world to write this work, Pound started Cantos in 1915 and died in 1972, with the Cantos unfinished.</p>
