      <h2>Ezra Pound: In Writing</h2>
<p>Ezra Pound started his poetic carrer in England, where he devised the poetic style, Imagism. In this, Pound embraced the idea that poetry should be a dry object of language, or merely the comparison of images. He illustrates this in his poem 'In a Station of the Metro':</p>
<blockquote>The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
  Petals on a wet, black bough.
</blockquote>
