      <h2>Gertrude Stein: In Writing</h2>
<p>Gertrude Stein sought to fuse art styles with writing, actively incorporating ideas of Cubism into her writing. She was directly influenced by cubist works of art, such as those of Picasso. In her first volume, <i>Three Lives</i>, Stein told three separate stories, all set in Baltimore, which were independent of each other but all important to the overall story. This organization was representative of Cubism, which fused various perspectives into one flat outlook, and one which directly influenced Stein in her writing of the story.</p>
<p> Stein forsook syntax, meaning, and plot in her stories to embrace this incorporation into her works, which she elaborated on in <i>Composition as Exploration</i>, and <i>Geographical History of America.</i> She was ridiculed for such sayings as "a rose is a rose is a rose", but was a mentor to many Modernist writers and went on to gain respect and recognition later on in the 20th century. </p>
