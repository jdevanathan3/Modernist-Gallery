      <h2>Amy Lowell: In Writing</h2>
<p>Amy Lowell wrote her first collection of poetry, <i>A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass</i>, in 1912, which quickly helped her rise to fame. She became the chief defendant of Imagism, a literary movement started by Ezra Pound, after Pound shifted to Vorticism, a different form of Imagism.</p>
<p>Lowell spent most of her life living together with another woman, Ada Dwyer Russell, and so celebrated female beauty in her poems. For example, in her poem <i>Venus Transiens</i>,published in 1919, Lowell  compares female beauty to godlike beauty:</p>
<blockquote>
Tell me, was Venus more beautiful<br>
Than you are<br>
When she topped<br> 
The crinkled waves, <br>
Drifting shoreward <br>
On her plaited shell? 
<br>
</blockquote>
<p>She herself draws an explicit comparison with the painting Venus by Botticelli in this work. Amy Lowell died shortly after in 1925.</p>
