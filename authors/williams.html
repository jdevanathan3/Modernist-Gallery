      <h2>Williams Carlos Williams: In Writing</h2>
<p>William Carlos Williams was strongly against the emigration and internationalism that Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot practiced, and so lived in New Jersey most of his life. In his poetry, Williams searched for phrasings, placements, and vocabulary that was truly American.</p>
<p>In Williams' collection <i>Spring and All</i>, the poem 'The Red Wheelbarrow' reats objects that belong together separately:</p>
<blockquote>
so much depends<br>
upon<br>
<br>
a red wheel<br> 
barrow <br>
<br>
glazed with rain<br> 
water<br>
<br>
beside the white<br> 
chickens<br>
</blockquote>
<p>The last word in each fragment is separated by a new line, which is especially significant in the separation of compound words, such as rainwater and wheelbarrow. This separation directs the reader's attention to each object in the poem, which became the foundation for Modernist Objectivism. Williams went on to write <i>This is Just to Say</i> in 1934, in which he was able to capture American speech in the form of an apologetic note.</p>
<p> Williams went on to heavily publish prose, as his initial poetry was heavily overshadowed by T.S. Eliot's <i>The Wasteland</i>. His works went on to be published later in the 20th century, outside the scope of early modernism. His early works became to be recognized as fundamental for later modernist works.</p>
