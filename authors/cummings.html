      <h2>Edward Estlin Cummings: In Writing</h2>
<p>Edward Estlin Cummings came to the public eye with his work <i>The Enormous Room</i> in the 1920's, which detailed his experiences as a detainee during World War 1. He was primarily known as a poet since then, and was particularly known for his unconventional use of the lower case. He further played with word arrangement and placement for humorous effect, as seen in his work 'anyone lived in a pretty howtown', which continues with 'with up so floating many bells down'. This makes for a light-hearted description of a whimsical town, primarily distinguished not by its description but by how it is described in improper order. </p>
<p>Cummings also had an ability to capture the mood of his era, through cliches and popular culture. In <i>Buffalo Bill's</i>, Cummings combines his unconventional use of the lower case and his incorporation of American popular culture to add a sharp twist to his work:</p>
<blockquote>
he was a handsome man<br>
and what i want to know is<br>
how do you like your blueeyed boy<br> 
Mister Death.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>In this segment, Cummings touches upon the cliche of the American legend, whose tales live on long after his death. By killing off the protagonist very early in the poem, with the clearly dead 'blueeyed boy' and the allusion to the afterlife with 'Mister Death', Cummings illustrates this very cliche. Furthermore, by only capitalizing Mister Death, and literally nothing else in the lines, he trivializes the hero in the poem, and shows the prominence of death above all else. </p>
<p>Cummings went on to use his work to point out issues in American society, and left a lasting effect on American culture and literature.</p>
