      <h2>About <i>Starry Night</i></h2>
<p>This work was created by Vincent Van Gogh in 1889. This painting was the ideal of Impressionism, and spawned many more Modernist works of art that used this format. Impressionism relied on afterimages of motion or light to portray a picture, rather than a distinct pictorial of a subject. Van Gogh manages to make a usually clear, or, perhaps, dotted, night seem tumultuous through his impressions. This strikes a similarity with the outlook of Modernist <a href = "authors/tseliot.html">T.S. Eliot</a>, who earlier in his career satirized elegant Romantic writing by interspersing the elegant writing style with slang and commonplace language in <i>The Lame Song of J. Alfred Pulfrock</i>, and later viewed his surroundings as alien, in which he was alone. Van Gogh, in painting this piece, was under emotional and mental stress, conveying that into the work.</p>
