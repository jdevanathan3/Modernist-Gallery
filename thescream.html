      <h2>About The Scream</h2>
<p> This work was painted by Edvard Munch in 1893, before the revolutionary art period of Modernist techniques. This piece, along with <a href = "starrynight.html">Van Gogh's <i>Starry Night</i></a>, served as precursors to art movements such as Expressionism and Impressionism, respectively. In this work, Munch distorts his surroundings to portray the feeling felt by the character in the picture, of pure fright and bewilderment. In the same way, <a href = "authors/stevens.html">Wallace Stevens</a> emphasized a focus not on the real surroundings, which was unlike most other Modernist writers, but rather on the extent of imagination. One can say this work of art represents that very realm, as Munch experienced the "scream" of nature while looking over a Norwegian landscape. This expression, as a figment of his imagination, took over an ordinary picture and made the imagination of the painter its primary focus. In the same way, Wallace Stevens emphasized the importance of imagination, and how the world was not guided by true will, but rather arbitrarily; he urged readers to all find a fiction, or a sense of their imagination, that they believed in. </p>
