        <h1>David Bomberg's The Mud Bath</h1>

      <h2>About The Mud Bath</h2>
<p>This work was created by David Bomberg in 1914, and is considered one of Britain's greatest works of modern art. It pictures a steam bath near Bomberg's residence, reduced to geometric figures and shapes which seemingly resemble people or other outlinings of a bath. This painting was classified under the genre of Vorticism, in which multiple images are juxtaposed in one painting. Although Bomberg was not a Vorticist, and did not wish for his work to be classified, it was what many contemporaries and scholars of art deemed as the nature of the work. </p>
<p> This painting strikes a very similar style to that of the works of Ezra Pound, who initially was a founder of Imagism, the idea of juxtaposing images with no clear action or analysis. One of his most famous works, <i>In a Station of the Metro</i>, aims to accomplish just that, and draws many similarities to this painting. The objects in the painting, although classified under a general category, are not clear in their relation; what parts they serve of The Mud Bath, or whether all the objects fully contribute to one aspect of the bath, is unclear. It is also interesting to note that Ezra Pound later shifted to a literary movement known as Vorticism, which highlighted on juxtaposing various images in a heightened form of Imagism.</p>
