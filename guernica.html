      <h2>About <i>Guernica</i></h2>
<p> <i>Guernica</i> was a cubist piece composed by Pablo Picasso, as his response to the Nazi bombing of the city Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. His use of Cubism, fusing multiple perspectives into one image, helps add to the chaos depicted in the picture, and the extremity of the situation through the perspectives of multiple victims. This very style of art is what inspired author <a href = "authors/stein.html">Gertrude Stein</a> to incorporate the same concept into her writings. In her fist book, <i>Three Lives</i>, Stein writes about three individual perspectives separately, and combines them into one book, similar to the fusion of perspectives Picasso uses in his paintings.</p>
