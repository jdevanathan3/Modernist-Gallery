      <h2>About <i>Abstract Speed and Sound</i></h2>
<p> <i>Abstract Speed and Sound</i> was painted by Giacomo Balla in late 1912 to early 1913. This painting was part of the Futurist movement in Italy, in which modern themes and objects were the subjects of paintings, and every painitng had a much more technical aspect than ever before. Instead of being concerned with how exactly to paint a subject, artists in the Futurist movement focused on painting futuristic images, themes, or concepts in a variety of different ways, in accordance with the technological boom that happened in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century with the advent of automobiles and factories. In a similar way, Modernist author <a href = "authors/cummings.html">Edward Estlin Cummings</a> explores the technicalities of writing, and fuses current American themes with his technicalities. In his works, Cummings rearranges words for humorous effect, as he did in <i>anyone lived in a pretty howtown</i>, and tends to put many of his words in lowercase, regardless of syntactical obligation. His experiments with technicalities and his ability to project trending themes of his culture makes his style, or, at least, purpose, very similar to that of the Futurists.  </p>
