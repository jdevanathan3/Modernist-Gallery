      <h2>Wallace Stevens: In Writing</h2>
<p>Stevens only rose to prominence in poetry in his thirties, with some of his poems appearing in Harriet Monroe's <i>Poetry</i> in 1914, with his own collection, <i>Harmonium</i>, being released in 1923. Wallace Stevens differs from other Modernist authors by capitalizing on the importance of imagination, and not merely capturing reality. In his work, "Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock", Stevens points out the disinteresting reality of most homes in the night, and draws an interesting parallel:</p>
<blockquote>
People are not going<br>
To dream of baboons and periwinkles.<br>
Only, here and there, an old sailor,<br>
Drunk and asleep in his boots,<br>
Catches tigers<br>
In red weather.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>In the above excerpt, Stevens points out that people's lives are so devoid of imagination that even their dreams are not outlandish. In making a reference to a drunk old sailor who may have a more interesting dream, Stevens makes a point about how lifestyle might factor in to imagination, or at least that alcohol spurs the imagination that other figures in the passage do not have.</p>
<p> Stevens wrote many of his works, from <i>The Worm at Heaven's Gate</i> in 1916 to <i>The Death of a Soldier</i> in 1918 with the conviction that the universe is arbitrary and empty, and that there is no one true will guiding the universe. Instead, he believed that we all must find a fiction that we can all believe.</p>
