      <h2>About Portrait De Metzinger</h2>
<p> This work was created by Robert Delaunay on canvas in 1906. The work is similar to that of a mosaic, where a general picture can be seen, but each individual part is highlighted. This is the art style of Divisionism, which seeks to break down an image into simple colors and display it like a palette array rather than a smooth blend of colors. This style is similar to the writing style of Modernist writer <a href = "authors/williams.html">William Carlos Williams</a>, who particularly emphasized separate parts of compound and hyphenated words through spaces and new lines. His poetry followed a style known as Objectivism, which sought to distinguish separate objects in writing, found by visually separating words and phrases. These two artists clearly share similarities in style, and are both Modernist artists writing around the same time period. </p>
